title: The Harper Firefox Extension
---

Harper is available for the millions who rely on Firefox for fast, private, and independent browsing.
Unlike most grammar tools, Harper's Firefox extension performs all analysis locallyâ€”never sending your text to the cloud.
Emails, chat messages, blog posts, and comments benefit from real-time grammar improvements, with your privacy intact.

To install, head to the [Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-grammar-checker-harper/) and select 'Add to Firefox'.

Curious how it works? The Firefox extension runs entirely on [`harper.js`](/docs/harperjs/introduction), our open-source JavaScript library.
