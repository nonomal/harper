title: Brill Tagging
---

Harper uses Brill tagging as a refinement step to a dictionary-based [POS tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) approach.
This method retains low-latency and high-throughput without bundling a large, high-entropy language model.

While documentation on this site is sparse, initial development was accompanied by [a blog post](https://elijahpotter.dev/articles/transformation-based_learning), which can hopefully explain some of the more abstract details of the process.
